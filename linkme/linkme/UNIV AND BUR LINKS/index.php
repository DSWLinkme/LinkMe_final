                                <p> Why is it important to study culture and society?
                                    It helps us answer certain questions like why do we need to follow rules and what impact can our actions make to other people. Culture study, in general, allows us to understand how the different cultures came about. It also gives an overview of how peoples' behaviors vary from one place to another.15 Mar 2017</p>
